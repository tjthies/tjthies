In Alien Invasion, the player controls a space ship that is at the bottom of the
screen. The player uses the arrow keys to move the space ship and the space bar 
to fire bullets at the aliens. At the beginning of each game, the sky will fill 
with aliens, which the player must shoot down. After the last alien is shot down, 
a more difficult level will begin. If any Alien reaches the bottom of the screen 
or any of the ships, the player loses a ship. After losing three ships, the game 
ends.
